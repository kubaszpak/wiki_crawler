# wiki_crawler 

This script is used for crawling all category names from a wikipedia page.

Big part of it is specific to the webpage I needed which is this one - [wikipedia](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategoria:Marki_samochod%C3%B3w)

To use it you will firstly need to:

        pip install BeautifulSoup
        pip install requests


And then simply run it with:

        python get_names.py
